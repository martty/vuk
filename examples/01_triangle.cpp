/* 01_triangle
 * In this example we will draw a bufferless triangle, the "Hello world" of graphics programming
 * For this, we will need to define our pipeline, and then submit a draw.
 *
 * These examples are powered by the example framework, which hides some of the code required, as that would be repeated for each example.
 * Furthermore it allows launching individual examples and all examples with the example same code.
 * Check out the framework (example_runner_*) files if interested!
